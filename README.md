# Boost Asio C++ Network Programming

## Dependencies

- [Boost Asio](https://think-async.com/Asio/](https://www.boost.org/users/download/)https://www.boost.org/users/download/)

## Package Manager
I have done my fair share of CMAKE, will dive into it deeper when the time comes. Right now the package manager combination that has saved my life and time are:

- [Conan](https://github.com/conan-io/conan)
- [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/)
- [Conon Clion Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/11956-conan)

Highly recommend.
